# Zero-Shot Recommendation with Language Modeling
Resources accompanying the "Zero-Shot Recommendation as Language Modeling" paper published at ECIR2022, where we show that pretrained large language models can act as a recommender system, and compare few-shot learning results to matrix factorization baselines.

# Huggingface dataset
We provide a version of our dataset on Huggingface datasets ðŸ¤—:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("sileod/movie_recommendation")
```
A version of this dataset was also included in BIG-Bench.
